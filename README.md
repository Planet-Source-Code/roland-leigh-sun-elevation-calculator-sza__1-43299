### Description

Calculates the Solar Zenith Angle for a given day, time, latitude and longitude. In other words, the elevation angle of the sun at a given time and place. Functionality is included for calculating Dawn, Dusk and Noon times for specified times or periods, and outputting to file.

I originally needed this for some atmospheric research I was doing, and I couldn't find any simple application on the web, so having eventually found the algorithm and coded it, I thought I'd make it into a little VB module, and application, which might be of use to the next person who needs to know how high the sun is.

The application includes examples of:

- Manipulation of Date and Time variables

- Use of Timers to run clocks and updating displays

- Simple outputting of data to screen

- Simple outputting of data to a text file

I hope it's helpful to someone out there :-)
 
### More Info
 
Date, Time, latitude, Longitude.

Nothing.. explanations in code.

Solar Zenith Angle (the angle between a line straight up, and a line to the sun)
